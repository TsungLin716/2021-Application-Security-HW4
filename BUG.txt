The vulnerability exists within the authentication for card users. In UseCard.kt, it calls CardInterface.kt to use the card number and token. However, it does not check if the token matches the current user which means that the user can use other cards as their giftcard. The solution to this is that we should add the verification for ownership on the server side. We need to check that if the user ID of the giftcard actually matches the user him/herself based on the logging process. If not, then we deny it and make the operation invalid.
